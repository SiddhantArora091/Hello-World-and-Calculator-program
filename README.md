# C++ Project: Hello World & Basic Arithmetic Calculator

## üìò Theory

This project demonstrates foundational concepts of the C++ programming language, focusing on:

- Output to the console using `cout`
- User input using `cin`
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Variable declaration and usage
- Structure and syntax of a C++ program

It is designed as a beginner-friendly example to help new programmers understand how to build and run simple programs using C++.

## üîç Overview

The project consists of two small programs written in C++:

1. **Hello World Program**:  
   A simple message output program that prints a greeting message using `cout`.

2. **Arithmetic Calculator Program**:  
   A basic calculator that:
   - Takes two floating-point numbers from the user
   - Computes and displays the sum, product, division, and subtraction of the inputs

These programs are implemented to reinforce concepts such as:
- Standard I/O
- Data types
- Mathematical expressions
- Flow of execution

## üí° Concept

### Key Concepts Covered:

- **Input/Output Streams**: Using `cin` and `cout` from the iostream library
- **Data Types**: Usage of `float` to handle decimal values
- **Operators**: Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- **Program Structure**: Understanding `main()` function and return types
- **Comments**: Code is documented using single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments

## üéØ Purpose

The main purposes of this project are:

- To introduce beginners to the syntax and structure of C++.
- To demonstrate how to write a program that interacts with the user.
- To show how basic operations can be performed with minimal code.
- To serve as a starting point for students learning C++ programming in school or college.

It can be used as a classroom example or as a personal practice exercise for learners.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet complete demonstration of how C++ can be used to build console applications. It combines both static output (Hello World) and interactive user input (Calculator) to offer a well-rounded beginner experience. Mastering these basics is essential before moving on to more complex topics like
